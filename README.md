# calculazer-rs
A rusty calculator using bitwise operations.

To run properly make sure your terminal window is full screen 
(otherwise the ASCII art will be distorted). Also, the program 
clears your terminal--SO DON'T PANIC! You still have full 
control of your terminal.

### DEPENDENCIES
1. Lastest stable version of Rust

### INSTRUCTIONS
1. Download repo
2. Make terminal full screen
3. Run `cargo run` from the root directory

Hit `Ctrl-C` anytime to exit.

Enjoy!
