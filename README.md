# calculazer
A calculator using binary math (bit shifts) written in Rust.

To run properly make sure your terminal window is full screen 
(Otherwise the ASCII art will be distorted). Also, the program 
clears your terminal--SO DON'T PANIC! You still have full 
control of your terminal and did not lose anything.

This project is not yet complete as it only handles u8 inputs 
intentionally for a particular use case I was working with.

DEPENDENCIES:
(1) Lastest stable version of Rust. </n>

INSTRUCTIONS:
(1) Download repo.</n> 
(2) Make terminal full screen.</n>
(3) Run `cargo run` from the root directory.</n>

Hit `Ctrl-C` anytime to exit.

Enjoy!
